This script create and updates a dataset of Blood bowl 2 dice odds for a given league

Created by scraping Goblinspy.

The main script to run is: dice_odds.R

Requires docker to be installed and running to drive RSelenium

Known problems: 
- how to accurately detemine block die odds - still a major question
- will break if it somehow misses a game between two (ie can only update from most recent to newest)
